Environmental_Data.csv has these columns:

- timestamp
- location
- temperature (°C)
- humidity (%)
- co2 (ppm)
- pm2_5 (µg/m³)
- pm10 (µg/m³)
- noise (dB)
- aqi (Air Quality Index) 

The machine learning should predicts the aqi based on the other numerical features (temperature, humidity, co2, pm2_5, pm10, noise).

Retraining the ML Model : 
Process of feeding new or updated environmental data (like air quality, humidity, temperature, etc.) 
into the machine learning system so it can:
- Learn new patterns,
- Improve its predictions,
- Stay relevant with recent trends.

🧰 How Can Analysts Do This in GaiaTrack?
As a software engineer, you’d build this feature into the UI so it’s intuitive:

🔽 Step-by-Step (from Analyst's POV)
1. Upload New Data (CSV File)
- Analyst clicks “Upload Data” button.
- Uploads a .csv (e.g., environmental_data_2025.csv).

2. Click “Retrain Model”
- A button triggers the training process.
- Behind the scenes, it runs a Python script that:
- Reads the new CSV,

Cleans & prepares the data,

Retrains the model using scikit-learn (or similar),

Saves the updated model as a .pkl file.

Get Feedback

UI shows messages like:

✅ Model retrained successfully!

📉 Accuracy improved by 4.2%

🕒 Training completed in 12 seconds

Preview Model Accuracy

Display a small summary:

Training accuracy, testing accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

🔒 Optional Safeguards
To keep it safe and effective:

Only allow retraining from validated users (e.g., Admin, Analyst roles).

Limit frequency (e.g., not more than once a day).

Keep logs: who retrained it, when, using which data.

🧑‍💻 What You Build in Backend (as Engineer)
A Django view or API that:

Accepts CSV uploads

Runs train_model.py on click

Updates a stored model file (e.g., model.pkl)

Save training stats for display

Use job queue (e.g., Celery) if it takes time
